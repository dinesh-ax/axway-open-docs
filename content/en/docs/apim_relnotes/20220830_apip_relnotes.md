## Installation

API Portal is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in a Docker container. For more information, see the following options:

* If you are installing API Portal for the first time using this update, see [Install API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/).
* If you are already using API Portal (7.5.x, 7.6.x, 7.7.x) and want to install this update, see [Upgrade API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/).
* If you are using API Portal 7.7.x with an applied patch and you want to install this update, you need to execute one manual step. See [Upgrade API Portal prerequisites](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/upgrade_automatic/#api-portal-with-applied-patches).

## Known issues

The following are known issues for this update.

### Custom properties permissions per role are not respected in some scenarios

Custom properties permissions per role will not be respected for the organization in the following scenarios:

* Permissions will not be respected for the organization the API is assigned to because respecting them will cause significant performance impact on the Try-it page. The custom properties permissions will follow the role of the user's primary organization.
* On creating an application, the App has no organization yet, so the custom properties permissions cannot be respected per role of the organization. They will follow the permissions for the role of the primary organization of the user.

### When Multi Manager feature is configured, API Portal users are no longer able to login

After a recent bug fix in API Manager (RDAPI-20021), the `Authenticate to Master` policy is no longer working after upgrading from releases earlier than [API Portal July 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200730_apip_relnotes/). To fix this, perform the following steps:

1. Open all slave managers configurations in Policy Studio, and click to **Edit** the `AuthenticateToMaster` policy.
2. Click the **Login to Master** (Connect to URL) filter, and enter `Accept: */*` for the **Request Protocol Header**.
3. Click the **Enter** key twice to create two blank lines after `Accept: */*`.

Alternatively you can take the updated `AuthenticateToMaster` policy and apply again your configurations.

### Page layout and alignment for Arabic language

Changing the API Portal language to Arabic (or any other right to left language) results in issues with page layout and alignment on the API Portal Home and Pricing pages, and some buttons are not visible. As a workaround, you can turn on the development mode in JAI. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to Joomla! Admin Interface (JAI).
2. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Templates**.
3. Click your template style (for example, `purity_III * Default`) to open it.
4. Click the **General** tab.
5. Change **Development Mode** to `ON`.
6. Click **Save** and click **Close** to close the template style.
